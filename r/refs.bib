The fastest known algorithm for uniform generation of these graphs (McKay and Wormald in J.

	Abstract = {We consider a family of random graphs with a given expected degree sequence. Each edge is chosen independently with probability proportional to the product of the expected degrees of its endpoints. We examine the distribution of the sizes/volumes of the connected components which turns out depending primarily on the average degree d and the second-order average degree d{\textasciitilde}. Here d{\textasciitilde} denotes the weighted average of squares of the expected degrees. For example, we prove that the giant component exists if the expected average degree d is at least 1, and there is no giant component if the expected second-order average degree d{\textasciitilde} is at most 1. Examples are given to illustrate that both bounds are best possible.},

	Abstract = {We consider the stability of k-means clustering problems. Clustering stability is a common heuristics used to determine the number of clusters in a wide variety of clustering applications. We continue the theoretical analysis of clustering stability by establishing a complete characterization of clustering stability in terms of the number of optimal solutions to the clustering optimization problem. Our results complement earlier work of Ben-David, von Luxburg and P{\'a}l, by settling the main problem left open there. Our analysis shows that, for probability distributions with finite support, the stability of k-means clusterings depends solely on the number of optimal solutions to the underlying optimization problem for the data distribution. These results challenge the common belief and practice that view stability as an indicator of the validity, or meaningfulness, of the choice of a clustering algorithm and number of clusters.},

	Abstract = {Most studies of networks have only looked at small subsets of the true network. Here, we discuss the sampling properties of a network's degree distribution under the most parsimonious sampling scheme. Only if the degree distributions of the network and randomly sampled subnets belong to the same family of probability distributions is it possible to extrapolate from subnet data to properties of the global network. We show that this condition is indeed satisfied for some important classes of networks, notably classical random graphs and exponential random graphs. For scale-free degree distributions, however, this is not the case. Thus, inferences about the scale-free nature of a network may have to be treated with some caution. The work presented here has important implications for the analysis of molecular networks as well as for graph theory and the theory of networks in general.},
