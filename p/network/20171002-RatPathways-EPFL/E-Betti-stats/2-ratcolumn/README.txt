Experiment 1

Compute the Betti numbers of the ratcolumn graph using the max-cliques from ../C-graph1/OUTPUT/UV/column-b-maxcliques.pkl .


Experiment 2

a) Track the number of cliques in the ratcolumn graph as edges between distant nodes are dropped.

b) Track the number of cliques in the ratcolumn graph as edges are dropped randomly.


Experiment 3

a) Track the Betti numbers in the ratcolumn graph as edges between distant nodes are dropped.

b) Track the Betti numbers in the ratcolumn graph as edges are dropped randomly.
